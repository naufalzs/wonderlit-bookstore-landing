## Wonderlit Bookstore
"Wonderlit Bookstore" is an exploratory project aiming to create a landing page that provides an overview of the bookstore while also encouraging visitors to make purchases or subscribe. I developed this responsive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JS. The slider was implemented using Swiper, and the icons are powered by Boxicons. The page is currently live and accessible at the following URL:
